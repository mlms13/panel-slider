The World Needs More Slider Plugins!!
=====================================

Description
-----------

Seriously, if there's anything jQuery needs, it's more half-baked slideshow plugins. For bonus points, make it around 200 lines of barely-tested code. Something that really doesn't go out of its way to handle edge cases would be perfect.

Example
-------

I have no idea what the requirements are for setting this thing up, but hopefully examples will be helpful. Check out the demo files in this repository for help getting started. There's also [an example on CodePen](http://codepen.io/mlms13/pen/kIvab).

License
-------

This plugin may not have a lot of features or really any documentation to speak of, but it sure has a license.  MIT. Boom.  Pretty much you can do whatever you want with it, as long as my name (or at least a link to this Github page) shows up in the source code somewhere.
